# For Contributors

Using Clean Code pratices is everything we expect from you to contribute with this project.

## Pull request titles

We are using [conventional-commit](https://conventionalcommits.org/) for our commit messages. Since all PRs are squashed, we enforce this format for PR titles rather than individual git commits. A [`commitlint` bot](https://github.com/paulirish/commitlintbot) will update the status of your PR based on the title's conformance.

Please, see Pull Request Template for more details
